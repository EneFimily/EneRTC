EneRTC
======

This project is a video/audio chat with webrtc between two brower. 
First, I create a webrtc client, use it I can get meida, webrtc offer and answer and so on.

Second, create webrtc connection, I need to transport webrtc offer and answer between two brower. I just transport webrtc offer and answer to server. And the server transport the singnals to the brower which need the singnal.

Third, to transport the singals, I need draw up a protocol.

So this is my EneRTC project.
